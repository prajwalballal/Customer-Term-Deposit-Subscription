# Customer-Term-Deposit-Subscription
Business Problem:  After investigating a revenue decline for the bank, it was found that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can lend more and thus make more profits. In addition, banks also hold a better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. Predict accurately whether the customer will subscribe to the focus product for the campaign - Term Deposit after the campaign?
